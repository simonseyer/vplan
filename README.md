# FLS Vplan

This Xamarin app serves the pupil and teacher of the school Friedrich-List-Schule Wiesbaden 
as a way to get notified about changes in their daily schedule. 
It fetches data from the official school server and visualizes them in the app.

## Features

* Modern and clear user interface
* Customized list of changes by school class (right on the device)
* Background updates
* Push notifications on new changes
* Sharing of changes as picture/text/calendar event

### iOS App

* Tactile feedback
* 3D touch to highlight and share changes

## Purpose

This app serves multiple purposes:

* Providing a modern and convenient way for pupil/teacher to get informed about changes
* Giving pupil/students the opportunity to explore a full fleshed app with a real-world use case
* Creating a blueprint app that could be offered and customized for almost every school

## Contribution

All types of contribution are welcome. Whether you are a student just getting into programming or
a seasoned developer, feel free to contribute code/documentation or ask questions/create tickets.

## Roadmap

The iOS app is almost ready for publishing. All basic features are implemented and are working well. 
The following list shows where I am heading with the project:

1. Final touches on and publishing of the iOS app
1. Bringing the Android app on par with the iOS app
1. Adding extensive code and architecture documentation to improve accessibility to the code
1. Create a standalone server and add support for remote notifications
